-- phase: expand
-- OpenVibe.Work: listing pages in OpenVibe.Search (server/search-index.js, openvibe-publishing/search-feed).
-- event_outbox holds the work.index_document.* events until the relay delivers them to OpenVibe.Events (written in
-- the same transaction as the revision that produced them); work_index_revisions is the index sequencer, the last
-- revision and content hash Search was sent for each page, so an unchanged page is never sent twice.
